This is the test task from UpTrader.

## Frontend

Frontend is my weakness. I don't really like frontend. I don't have any imagination to do frontend.
I never had someone who would draw me design to make frontend. I don't want to do frontend.

## Usage

### Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the server
`python manage.py runserver`

`Note`: You don't need to apply migrations, since I didn't include the database to the `.gitignore` file.

## Admin panel

`user`: admin

`password`: admin
